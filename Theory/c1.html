  <span style="font-family: work sans;"><p style="font-family: work sans; margin-left: 30px;"><H1>Data, Information and Knowledge</H1>
    <b>Data:</b> A collection/string of text, numbers, symbols, images or sound in raw or unorganized form that has no meaning on its own.<Br><br>
    <b>Information:</b> Data that has been processed and given context and meaning and can be understood on its own.<br>
     Information is much more refined data. Data is given context by identifying what sort of data it is.<br>
     For example :- <B>PC</B> is data without any context. After identifying that PC stands for Pranav Chugh we can classify it as information.
    
    <h1>Data sources</h1>
    A <B>direct data source</B> (primary source) is data that has been collected first hand, usually by the person who intends to use that data.<Br><br>

        <Br><table><tr>
            <th>Advantages:-</th>
            <th>Disadvantages:-</th>
        </tr>
        <tr">
            <td> Collected data will<Br> be relevant to the purpose.</td>
            <td>It can be expensive to collect<br> since companies might have<br> to be hired to collect them</td>
            <Tr ><td>Original source is verified.</td>
            <td>Will take a long time to collect</td></Tr>
            <tr>
            <td> Data can be sold for other purposes</td>
            <td> Taking large data samples is difficult</td></tr>
        </tr>
        <tr><Td> Data will be Up to date</Td>
        <td> May involve having to purchase<Br> printers, loggers, computers etc</td></tr>
            <Tr><Td>It can be presented in the<br> required format</Td>
            <Td> By the time the project is completed,<Br> data might have gone out of date</Td></Tr>
            <Tr><Td> It is likely to be unbiased</Td></Tr>     
   </table>
    
    
    <B>Indirect data:-</B>
    This is data that has been collected for a <i>different purpose</i>
     from a secondary; pre-existing source.<Br> It has often been collected by a different person or organization.
        <Br><br><table><tr>
            <th>Advantages:-</th>
            <th>Disadvantages:-</th>
        </tr>
        <tr">
            <td>Data is immediately available, and<br> large samples for statistical analysis<br>
                 are more likely to be available</td>

        <tr><Td></Td>
        <td> Sorting and filtering might be required<br> to get rid of additional or irrelevant data.</td></tr>
   </table><br>
   
    
    
    
    
    <B>Static information source:-</B>
    Static data is data that does not change regularly. It can be viewed offline and has a high<br>
 chance of being accurate since the information would have been validated before entering.<br>
  Tends to go out of date quickly. As soon as it is created it is difficult to add information to it.	<br><Br>
    
    <B>Dynamic information source:-</B>
    Dynamic data is data that is <i>updated</i> once the source data changes.
    Information is most likely up to date.<Br> There can be many contributors to the data.<Br><br>
    
    
   <B> <h3 style="color:#0C96FF ;">Direct data sources:-</h3></B><Br>
    <b>Questionnaires-</b> Often collected from individuals, can be hard copy or online.<Br>
     Most questions are close ended. They make it easy to analyse and interpret the results as all questions are the same.<br>
     Large amounts of data can be collected, although many times the individuals<br>
     would fill the form not honestly due to <u style="cursor: pointer;
     " title="Type of response bias where survey respondents answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others">
    social desirability</u> or for an incentive that is provided at the end of the form.<br><br>
    <b>Interviews-</b> This form of data collection allows the interviewer to collect more data as
     responses can be collected in depth (questions are usually open ended)<Br>
     This form can be costly to conduct and takes time to collect a large amount of data. It can be expensive and the interviewee<br>
      might answer dishonestly or lie to act <u style="cursor: pointer;
      " title="Type of response bias where survey respondents answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others">socially desirable.</u>
    
    <h1>Quality of Information</h1><Br>
    <B>Accuracy-</B> Data <i>must be accurate</i> in order to be considered of good quality. Typos, spelling mistakes, misplaced characters<br> are all examples of <i>inaccurate data.</i><br><Br>
    <b>Relevance:</b> Information must be <I>relevant</I> to its purpose. Data must meet the requirement of the user.<BR>
     Being given the rental price of a car when you want to buy one is an example of <i>irrelevant data.</i><Br><Br>
   <B> Age:</B> Information must be <i>up to date</i>. Old information is likely to be out of date<Br> and therefore no longer useful.<br><br>
    <B>Level of detail:</B> There needs to be <i>just the right amount of information</i> for it to be good quality.<Br>
     Everything must be specified.<Br><br>
    <b>Completeness:</b> <i>All information should be present</i>. Not having information means it cannot be used properly.<br><br>
    
    <h1>Encryption</h1>
    <b>Encryption</b> is the process of scrambling data so that it cannot be understood without a decryption key.
    <br> This makes it unreadable if intercepted. Data can be encrypted when stored on disks or even when sent across a network.<Br>
    
    <span class="material-icons">
      priority_high
        </span>
        <b>Symmetric encryption:</b> This is the oldest method of encryption. requires both the sender and receiver to possess the
        secret encryption and decryption key(s).<br>
         Requires the <u title="a piece of information that is used to decrypt and encrypt messages" style="cursor: pointer;">
        secret key</u> to sent to the recipient. Sender encrypts message using secret key.
          Same key is used to decrypt the message by the recipient.<Br>
        <img src="../elements/symmetric_encryption.png" alt="Symmetric encryption chart"
         style="width: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/><Br><Br>
    
   <b> Asymmetric encryption:</b> This overcomes the issue with symmetric encryption where there is a chance of the secret key being intercepted as well.<br>
    This method includes a <i><B>public key</B></i> which is available to everyone and a <i><b>private key</b></i>
     which is known only to the recipient.<Br>
     The sender encrypts data using the public key and the recipient decrypts it using their matching private key. <br>
     <img src="../elements/asymmetric_encryption.png" alt="asymmetric encrption chart" style="width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
    
    <b>*Requirements for a public key</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Organisation name</li>
        <li>Organisation that issued the certificate (<u style="cursor: pointer;" title="dont write this in paper its just an example">verisign</u>)</li>
        <li>Users email address</li>
        <li>Users country</li>
        <li>Users public key
        </li>
      </ul>
       
    
    <B>Asymmetric encryption</B> is used in <u title="Secure socket layer" style="cursor: pointer;">SSL</u>
     and <u title="transport layer security" style="cursor: pointer;" >TLS</u> (mainly used in banking apps) protocol.
     When a browser wants to interact with a secure page<Br>
     it will check the digital certificate to ensure that the site is trusted.<br><Br>
    
    <h1>Validation</h1>
    <i>The process of checking if data matches acceptable rules. </i><br><Br>
    
    <b>Presence check:</b> This check ensures that data is entered into a field and not left blank.<Br><Br>
    <b> Range check:</b> Ensures that data is within a defined range. It includes 2 boundaries. An upper and lower boundary.<Br><br>
    <b>Type check:</b> Ensures that the data must be of defined data type. For ex- if age is entered, must be an integer. <br><Br>
    <b>Length check:</b> Checks the length of the number of characters in a field, unlike range check which checks<br>
     if the value falls in a certain range. For ex- password must be 6 characters long.<br><Br>
    <b>Format check:</b> Ensures data matches a defined format<br><Br>
    <b>Lookup check:</b> rests to see if data exists in a list. Similar to referential integrity.<br><Br>
    <b>Consistency check:</b> compares data in one field with data in another field that already exists within a record,<br>
     to check their consistency. For ex- if gender is Male, user must be referred to as Mr.<br><Br>
    <b> Check digit:</b> Number or letter added to end of the field. It is the sum of an algorithm that takes place<br>
     on the digits before it. For ex 192937. The final digit 7 is a result of the 2nd digit – the 5th digit + the 1st digit. 9-3+1=7<br><Br>
    <img src="../elements/check_digit.png" alt="check digit chart" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;">
    <h1>Verification</h1>
    <b>Verification</b> means to check that the data on the original source document is identical to the data you have entered in the system.<Br>
    <b>Visual check:</b> The process of visually, manually looking at the data to ensure that it is correct and accurate.<Br><Br>
    <b>Double data entry:</b> Have 2 people enter the same data and compare it OR have one person enter the same data twice<Br>
     and compare it to one another.<br><Br>
    <b>Parity check:</b> A parity bit is a bit that has been added to a block of data to detect any errors. The bit can be either 0 or 1.<br>
     In <b><I>even parity</I></b> check, if the total number of 1bits are <i>even</i> then the parity bit must <i>remain 0</i> to keep the sum even.
     <br> For <b><I>odd parity</I></b>, if the number of 1bits are <i>even</i> then the parity bit must <i>change to 1</i> such that the sum of the bits are odd.<Br><Br>
    <B>Checksum:</B> A checksum is a value used to <i>verify the integrity of the data</i>. It can be calculated using many different algorithms,<br>
     for ex a simple checksum can be the number of bytes in a file. When a checksum value does not match the source data after transmission<br>
     we can conclude that it was a result of an interruption in the internet, corrupted disks, third party interfering with the data etc.<Br><br>
    <b>Hash total:</b> A hash total is the <i>numerical sum of one or more fields in the file</i>. When needed,<Br>
    the hash total is recalculated and compared with the original. If data is lost or mismatched,<Br>
     we can conclude the errors in transmission.<Br><Br>
    <b>Control total:</b> A control total is very similar to a hash total but is <i>only carried out on numerical fields</i>.
    
   <h1> Data processing</h1>
    <B>Batch processing:</B> Batch processing is a way to process large volumes of data. A group of transactions are collected over time.<br>
    They are collected, entered and processed after which the results are produced.<br><Br>
    <b>Master and transaction file:</b> In such a system, the main data is stored in the <i>‘master’</i> file. The data is sorted using a primary key.<br>
     All the data that has to be updated in the master file is known as a <u style="cursor: pointer;" title="a single logical unit of work which accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database">transaction.</u>
     The input data is stored in the transaction file before<Br>
    being used to update the master file.<Br><br>
    <b>3 main types of transactions are</b><Br>
    <b>Adding</b> new record<Br>
    <B>Deleting</B> a record<br>
    <b>Updating</b> an existing record<br>

    <Br><table><tr>
        <th>Advantages:-</th>
        <th>Disadvantages:-</th>
    </tr>
    <tr">
        <td>Single process which requires minimal human participation</td>
        <td>Delay as data is not processed until a specific time</td>
        <Tr ><td>Can be scheduled to occur when there<Br> is little demand for computer resources</td>
        <td>Errors cannot be identified and corrected until the data is processed</td></Tr>
        <tr>
        <td> Reduces chance for human error</td>
        <td> </td></tr>
    </tr>
    <tr><Td>Fewer repetitive tasks for operator</Td>
    <td> </td></tr>
</table>
    
    <b>Online processing</b>
    This is a type of processing which deals a <i>small amount of data at a time</i>. The transaction must be instant.<Br>
     Its applications are when the master file must be kept up to date. For ex a travel agency selling tickets for their tour. <Br>
    Once the computer starts processing the transactions it will not process any other data until the current transaction is completed.<Br><Br>
    
    <B>Real time processing</B>
    Real time systems are required to <i>process information rapidly</i>. Most real time systems process data at an instant.<Br>
     An application for this is in the use of a missile guidance system. Once a missile has been launched,<Br>
     the system must control its variables such as fins, speed instantly. Due to the high velocity of the missile<Br>
     the inputs must be processed very quickly to affect the output.
    Most real time systems are control systems.
