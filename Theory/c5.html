                <li>Remove data about your location that is normally attached to your photos and videos that you may post, such as <b>geotags</b>.</li>
                    <li>  Use a <b>virtual private network</b> (VPN), an encrypted connection that can be used to send data more securely across a network.<Br>
                     It <u>changes or masks the users IP address</u>

            <h1>Phishing</h1>
            <b>Phishing</b> occurs when someone sends an email that <i>appears genuine</i> to a user. The email includes a <mark>link to a website</mark><Br>
             that also appears <i>authentic</i>. Users are urged to click the link and provide personal information on a form or by replying<Br>
             to the email. They are <i>deceived into disclosing their personal data</i> to what they believe is a real source.<Br>
             However, both the email and the linked website are from a fake unauthorised source. <Br><Br>
            <b>How to recognise phishing</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t open emails that are not from a sender you recognise or a trusted source.</li>
                <li>Reputable companies will <i>never request your personal information</i> via email.</li>
                <li>Be cautious of any email asking for such details and <i>treat it with immediate suspicion</i>.</li>
                <li>Legitimate companies will never ask you for your personal data using email.</li>
                <li>Be immediately suspicious of any email that requests your personal data.</li>
                <li>Be suspicious of any email that contains <i>bad grammar or spelling mistakes</i></li>
                <li>A link in an email from a legitimate company will also normally <i>contain the domain name</i> of the company</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>Smishing</h1>
            <b>Smishing</b> (or SMS phishing) is a <i>variant of phishing</i> that uses <u>SMS text messages to lure the user</u> into providing<Br>
             their personal details. The user is sent an SMS text message that either contains a link to a website, in the same way that phishing does,<Br>
             or it will ask the user to call a telephone number to resolve an urgent issue.<Br>
            <Br><b>Minimize risk of Smishing</b><Br>
                Similar guidance applies to smishing as it does for phishing.<Br>
           <ul>
                 <li>The user must question at all times any link that are sent from an unknown or suspicious user.</li>
                  <li>
                      It's recommended that if a user thinks the message might be legitimate,
                     they should manually enter<Br> the legitimate company's domain name into their web browser
                     instead of clicking the link
                 in the message.</li><Br><Br>
           </ul>
            
            <h1>Vishing</h1>
            <b>Vishing</b>, or voice phishing, shares the same objective as phishing: acquiring a user's personal details.<Br>
             In vishing, <u>users receive a telephone call</u>, which may be automated or involve a real person. An automated voice<Br>
             might inform the user of a supposed issue, like <i>suspicious activity in their bank account</i>.<Br>
             They could be instructed to call another number or press a digit to reach another automated system,<br>
             <u>asking for their bank details</u> to resolve the issue. Alternatively, a real person may attempt to convince<Br>
             the user of an account problem, urging them to provide login details or a PIN under the guise of verifying their identity.<br>
             This unauthorized access can lead to criminal activities against the user.<Br><Br>
            <b>To prevent vishing</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Legitimate companies will never call you to request login details or PIN information over the phone.</li>
                <li>
                    While they may ask for other personal information, if there's any doubt about the caller's legitimacy,<Br>
                    it's wise to hang up and contact the company directly using a known and verified phone number.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>Pharming</h1>
            
            <b>Pharming</b> involves an unauthorized user installing <u>malicious code on a person's hard drive or computer</u>.<Br>
            This code <i>redirects users to a fake website resembling a legitimate one</i> when they enter the address. The intention is to deceive users<Br>
             into providing personal details on the fake site, unknowingly submitting their information to the unauthorized user.<Br><Br>
            A common pharming technique is called <u style="cursor: pointer;" title="The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet.">
            DNS cache poisoning</u>. The hackers <i>exploit vulnerabilities</i> in the domain name server and <mark>divert to internet traffic</mark> to a fake website.<Br>
            In simple words, the DNS a temporary record of the website URL and IP stored on your computer, these hackers change this information so that<Br>
             the next time you load up the website, it redirects you to the fake one instead.<Br><Br>
            <b>How to prevent pharming</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensure a functional <i>firewall is in place</i>. A firewall monitors both incoming and outgoing traffic from your computer.<Br>
                     Any traffic that fails to meet a criteria is flagged and prevented from proceeding. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Install an <i>antivirus program</i> specifically designed to identify malicious pharming code. Regularly scan your computer<Br>
                     for any potential threats.
                </li>
                 <li>
                     Be aware when using <i>public Wi-Fi connections</i>. A hacker could look to directly access your computer and install the malicious code<Br>
                      if you are connected to a public Wi-Fi connection. It is often advisable to use a VPN when using public Wi-Fi
                 </li>
                
            </ul>
            <h1>Malware</h1>
            <img src="../elements/viruses.webp" alt="malware catagories" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block;width: 350px;"> 
            <h1>Virus</h1> 
            A <b>virus</b> is the most commonly known type of malware. A virus is the only type of malware that infects new files in the computer system.<br>
            It attaches itself to a clean file, replicates itself, then attaches itself to another clean file. It is designed to spread,<Br>
             much like a human virus. If an infected computer is part of a network, it can then begin to infect other computers on the network<Br><Br>
            <b>Virus side effects</b>
            <ul>
                <li>slower system performance</li> 
                <li>files multiplying or duplicating on their own</li> 
                <li>files being deleted without your knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Minimizing risk of virus</b><Br><Br>
            A <b>robust anti-virus software</b> is needed to minimise the risk of a virus. You should install an anti-virus program<Br>
             and regularly scan your computer.<Br><Br>
            <b>Anti virus software</b><Br>
            Anti-virus software performs scans on a computer system, identifying files suspected of containing viruses. Upon detection,<Br>
             it <u>isolates these files in quarantine</u> and notifies the user. Users have the option to manually delete these quarantined files.<Br>
             It is possible to remove this stage and set the software to automatically delete all quarantined files.<Br>
            The anti-virus software can detect the presence of a virus in a file by <u>comparing the code to a database</u> of known virus codes.<Br>
             If it finds a code that matches it will quarantine the file. This is known as <u style="cursor: pointer;" title="technique for identifying viruses by checking files and code for suspicious behavior">
            heuristic</u> checking.<Br>
            A <i>notable vulnerability</i> of anti-virus software lies in its <i>dependency on its database</i>. If a perpetrator successfully hacks a system<Br>
             with a virus not documented in the database, the anti-virus software may fail to recognize and remove the threat.<Br>
            A <b>firewall</b> can also be used to minimise the risk of a virus. A firewall actively monitors both incoming AND outgoing <br>
            traffic within a computer system. 
            
            <h1>Trojan</h1>
            A <b>Trojan</b> is a type of malware that <i>disguises itself as legitimate software</i>, or is included in legitimate software that may have been infiltrated.<Br>
             They are mostly downloaded from an infected email or website. It looks harmless, but it hides a malicious program.<Br>
            <Br><Br><b>Minimize risk of trojan</b><Br>
            The main way to minimise the risk of a Trojan is to only open files and click to run software that you know is from a <u>trusted source</u>,<Br>
             for example, trusted software companies and trusted websites.
            <h1>Worm</h1>
            
            A <b>worm</b> is a type of malware similar to a virus, but it differs in a key way. Unlike a virus, a worm can replicate itself<Br>
             WITHOUT attaching to other programs. It exploits security weaknesses in a computer's operating system, aiming to fill up the free space<Br>
             and slow down the computer. Users may notice their computer running slowly and a rapid decrease in hard drive space as signs of a worm infection.<Br>
            Additionally, worms try to spread to other computers on a <i>network</i>, potentially affecting numerous machines. If they successfully<Br>
             spread across a network, they can clog up bandwidth and <mark>slow down the entire network</mark>.<Br><Br>
             <b>Minimize risk of worms</b><Br>
            To minimize the risk of worms which often exploit software vulnerabilities on a computers<Br>
             operating system or applications,   you should regularly check for, and install, updates for your operating system and your applications.<Br>
            <b>Anti-virus</b> software is equipped to detect worms, so conducting regular scans helps identify any worm infections on your computer. <Br>
            Worms often spread through network connections, so a safety measure is to <u>disconnect your computer from the network</u> when network resources are unnecessary<Br>
            
            <h1>Spyware</h1>
            The term spyware, covers a broad range of malware refers to any technology used to <mark>gather data about a person without their knowledge</mark>.<Br>
            A <b>key logger</b> records key presses from a keyboard and will allow the person who installed it to gather personal data about the person.<Br><Br>
                
            <b>To minimize risk of spyware</b>
            When downloading, especially free software or from sharing sites, <u>ensure it's from trustworthy sources</u>.<Br>
             Avoid clicking on links in pop-up ads.<Br>
            Carefully <u>read user agreements</u> for any hidden clauses, particularly regarding spyware and data sharing.<Br>
             Be cautious with cookies, as they can track your online activities. <u>Anti-malware</u> software helps scan for keylogging software
            <h1>Adware</h1>
            <b>Adware</b> is short for <i>advertising-supported-software</i> and used to display adverts that are targeted at the user.<Br><br>
            <b>Minimising the risk of adware</b>
            When downloading, carefully <i>inspect the list of components and uncheck anything that resembles adware</i>, like additional browser tools.<Br>
             Once adware is downloaded, <i>removing it can be challenging</i>, requiring multiple scans with anti-malware software for detection and removal<Br>
            <h1>Rootkit</h1>
            A <b>Rootkit</b> is a computer program that enables a person to <mark>gain administrator access to a victim’s computer</mark>. It allows the<Br>
             unauthorised user to do several criminal acts with the computer, such as hide illegal files on the computer, use the computer<Br>
             as part of a larger cyber attack or to steal personal data and information<Br><Br>
            <b>Minimising the risk of a rootkit</b>
             Rootkits are often installed through your <i>computer password being cracked</i>, or by another means such as embedded in a <Br>
            software download or installed on a USB memory stick. It is advisable to have a <b>strong password</b> set for your computer to minimise the risk<Br>
             of it being cracked. Download from trusted and reputable sources. A rootkit may be detected by anti-malware, but this is highly unlikely.<Br>
             Often, one of the only ways to rid a computer of a rootkit is to <mark>completely uninstall the operating system</mark>.
            
            <h1>Malicious bots</h1>
            A <b>bot</b> is an automated application designed for repetitive tasks. 
            <ul>
                <li>SPAM bots that flood email inboxes with spam</li>
                <li>Chatter bots mimic human behavior on social networking and dating sites</li>
                <li>
                    Zombie bots/Sleeper bots. The latter lies dormant on computers until activated, forming<Br>
                    bot networks to launch large-scale attacks on organizations by connecting compromised computers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Minimising the risk of bots</b>
             Bots are often embedded into links or software downloads and are often spread in the same way that phishing is carried out.<Br>
             Therefore, the same measures that can be taken to minimise phishing can be applied to bots<Br>
            <h1>Ransomware</h1>
            <b>Ransomware</b> is malware that <mark>restricts a user’s access to their computer system and files</mark>. The ransomware<Br>
             will normally demand that the user <i>pays a ransom in order to regain access</i> to their computer system.<Br><Br>
            <b>Minimising the risk of ransomware</b>
             As ransomware is distributed in a similar way to Trojans, the same guidelines for minimising the risk of Trojans can also<Br>
             be followed
