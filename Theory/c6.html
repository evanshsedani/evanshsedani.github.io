            <h1>Digital divide</h1>
The term  <b>digital divide</b> refers to the technology divide between countries, demographic groups and economic areas<Br><Br> 
<b>Groups affected by the digital divide:</b> 
<ul>
    <li>people living in <u>cities versus in rural areas</u></li> 
    <li>people <u>educated</u> in using technology versus uneducated in using technology</li>
    <li><u>older versus younger</u> people</li> 
    <li>areas that are <u>more industrially developed versus less industrially developed</u></li> 
    <li>different <u>socio-economic groups</u></li>
</ul>

<h1>Cities vs rural</h1>
The infrastructure for the availability of broadband and high-speed internet connections is much more developed in city locations<Br>
 than it is in rural locations. The most likely cause is linked to the higher concentration of people that live in a city,<Br>
 compared to a rural area.<Br><Br>
<b>Reducing the digital divide in rural areas</b><Br>
The quality of the infrastructure in rural areas could be improved. Many governments around the world are working with<Br>
 internet providers and offering incentives to improve the infrastructure in rural areas. One solution to this is to use <Br>
<mark>satellite technologies</mark>. This limits the amount of infrastructure that needs to be developed, whilst still providing access<br>
 to the internet.

<h1>Technology educated versus technology uneducated</h1>
Different types of technology have different interfaces and different methods for use. Without a certain level of education<Br>
 in how to use technology, it can <u>often seem very daunting</u>. There may be several different reasons why people are not<Br>
 technologically educated. It may be that they <u>do not have much access to technology</u> and therefore do not have much experience<Br>
 in using it. Certain individuals may <u>lack an interest in using technology</u>, yet <u>they are forced to do so</u> in order to<Br>
 access specific products and services.<Br><Br>
<b>Reducing the digital divide with the technologically uneducated</b> <Br>
One effective way of reducing the digital divide with the technologically uneducated is to provide accessible technology courses<Br>
 in local communities. Courses can be offered for free, or at a low cost, that people can attend to improve their education<Br>
 in the use of technology.

<h1>Older people versus younger people</h1>
Generational gap can pose challenges in effective communication between younger and older individuals. Younger people may feel<Br>
 much more confident using technology as they have far more experience with it. Older people may feel less confident about using technology<Br>
 because they have experienced a world before smart phones and the internet and have used alternative methods. They may feel that<Br>
 the use of <u>technology makes the task much more difficult</u>.<Br><Br>
<b>Reducing the digital divide between younger and older people</b>
One of the biggest barriers to older people using technology is likely to be <i>their fear of it</i>. Incentives to get <Br>
older people to <u>see the advantages of technology</u> are developing in many countries. Singapore is actively encouraging its older<Br>
 generation to embrace technology. Retirement villages incorporate various technologies, including <u>health-monitoring sensors</u>.

<h1>More industrially developed areas versus less industrially developed areas</h1>
Access to technology may be less in some areas because the countries are having to use their
 <u>
     financial resources to provide more<Br>
     important
 </u> services and <mark>DO NOT have the funds available to concentrate on the development of their technology services</mark>. Not having the<Br>
 access to technology and the internet could put them at both a <i>competitive and economic disadvantage</i>.<Br><Br>
<b>Reducing the digital divide in less industrially developed areas</b><Br>
<u>Satellite technology</u> may assist remote areas to access the internet. Governments can try to promote the business and products<br>
 that they could offer if they had better infrastructure and access to the internet. They <u>hope that other countries will invest</u><Br>
 and help the country to build the necessary infrastructure.
<h1>Different socioeconomic groups</h1>
<img src="../elements/techmoney.png" alt="expensive tech"style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 200px;">
Socio-economic groups often <b>revolves around cost</b>. Richer people can afford higher-speed internet connections and<Br>
 expensive advancements in technology. The <u>lack of access to information</u> can greatly impact the poor. People in poorer<Br>
 circumstances would <u>benefit from the education services such as free online learning platforms</u> would provide.<Br><Br>
<b>Reducing the digital divide in different socio-economic groups</b><Br>
Many countries are developing initiatives that provide technology at a subsidised rate or even for free to those in poorer communities.<Br>
 Many organisations are starting to work together to provide the internet in developing countries.
