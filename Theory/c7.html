            <h1>Expert systems</h1>
An <b>expert system</b> is a computerised system that attempts to reproduce the decision-making process of an expert human being<Br>
An expert system consists of several components. These components include: 
<ul>
    <li>a user interface</li> 
    <li>a knowledge base</li> 
    <li>an inference engine</li> 
    <li>an explanation system</li> 
    <li>method of output</li>
</ul>
An expert system operates by prompting the user to enter certain data using the <u>user interface</u>, referring to the <u>knowledge base</u><Br>
 and using the <u>inference engine</u> to aid the decision-making process it is designed to simulate
<h1>Components of an expert system</h1>
<img src="../elements/expert.png" alt="expert system components" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;width: 600px;">
<h1>User interface</h1>
 The user interface is the way that a user interacts with the expert system. It will guide the user about what data<br>
 they need to input into the expert system.
<h1>Knowledge base</h1>
The knowledge base is a database of related information about a particular subject. It allows the storage and retrieval of the knowledge<Br>
 required for an expert system to operate. In developing an expert system, <mark>experts are interviewed to gather their knowledge</mark> in a<Br>
 specific field. This knowledge is then used to build a database that is the knowledge base for the expert system.<Br>
 The developers will want two types of knowledge from the experts, factual knowledge and heuristic knowledge.<Br><Br>
 <b>Factual knowledge:</b> is definitive and commonly shared among experts.<br>
 <b>Heuristic knowledge:</b> is derived from personal experiences and reasoning.<Br><Br>
<b>Knowledge base editor</b>: a component of an expert system that is used to <mark>amend or update the knowledge base</mark>
<h1>Rules base</h1>
<b>Rules base</b> is part of the knowledge base. The rules base is a set of rules that will be used to produce an output or decision<Br>
 by the expert system. These rules are used by the inference engine as a base for reasoning, to obtain a solution to a problem<Br>
 or a decision. Each rule consists of two parts: the <span style="color: #0C96FF;">IF</span> and the <span style="color: #0C96FF;">THEN</span>. 
<h1>Inference engine</h1>
The <b>inference engine</b> is the part of the expert system that makes <u>judgements and reasoning</u> using the knowledge base<Br>
 and user responses. It is designed to produce reasoning based on the rules and the knowledge base. It will ask the user questions and,<Br>
 based on their answer, it will follow a line of logic.<Br>
 There are two main methods that an inference engine can use to simulate reasoning, these are <u>backward chaining and forward chaining</u>.<Br><Br>
<b>Backward chaining</b> is based on <u>goal driven reasoning</u>. In backward chaining, the system tries to take a goal and<Br>
 repeatedly split it into sub-goals that are simpler to achieve. The system starts with a goal or desired outcome and works backward <Br>
to find the facts that support that goal. It's like asking "<span style="color: #0C96FF;">Why</span>?" to trace back the reasoning.<Br>
 For ex: If the user reported flu, backward chaining would trace back to the rules and find, "IF flu THEN fever AND cough AND fatigue." Providing general symptoms of flu.<Br><Br>

<b>Forward chaining</b> is based on <u>data driven reasoning</u> and is dependent on the data that it is provided with. The system will<Br>
 take data input by the user and move forward from rule to rule to suggest a possible outcome. For ex if the user reports symptoms<Br>
 like <span style="color: crimson;">fever, cough, and fatigue</span>, the app might use forward chaining to conclude,<Br>
 "IF fever AND cough AND fatigue THEN it could be flu."

<h1>Explanation system</h1>
The explanation system is the part of an expert system that <u>provides an explanation of how an outcome was achieved</u><Br>
